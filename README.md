# AWS Lambda Function in Python for Bolt

Sample AWS Lambda Function in Python that utilizes [Python SDK for Bolt](https://gitlab.com/projectn-oss/projectn-bolt-python)

### Requirements

- Python 3.0 or higher
- [Python SDK for Bolt](https://gitlab.com/projectn-oss/projectn-bolt-python)

### Build From Source

* Clone the `Python SDK for Bolt` repository and navigate inside it

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/projectn-oss/projectn-bolt-python.git

cd projectn-bolt-python
```

* Make sure you have the latest versions of `setuptools` and `wheel` installed:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --upgrade setuptools wheel
```

* Now run this command from the root of the `Python SDK for Bolt` repository:

```bash
python3 setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

* This command should output a lot of text and once completed should generate two files in the dist directory:
 (we are interested in the .whl file)

```bash
dist/
  example_pkg_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1-py3-none-any.whl
  example_pkg_YOUR_USERNAME_HERE-0.0.1.tar.gz
```

* Clone the sample repository into the `python-sdk-lambda` directory.

```bash
git clone https://gitlab.com/projectn-oss/projectn-bolt-python-sample.git python-sdk-lambda
```

* Run this command (from the root of the `Python SDK for Bolt` repository) to install the boto3 sdk into the
  `python-sdk-lambda` directory. At this point all your code dependencies (for the python sdk, and boto3 + botocore)
  should have been installed.

```bash
pip install --target ./python-sdk-lambda ./dist/bolt_python_sdk-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
```

* create deployment package

```bash
cd python-sdk-lambda

zip -r bolt-python-lambda-demo.zip .
```

### Deploy

* Deploy the function to AWS Lambda by uploading the deployment package (bolt-python-lambda-demo.zip)

```bash
aws lambda create-function \
    --function-name <function-name> \
    --runtime python3.8 \
    --zip-file fileb://bolt-python-lambda-demo.zip \
    --handler BoltS3OpsHandler.lambda_handler \
    --role <function-execution-role-ARN> \
    --environment "Variables={BOLT_URL=<Bolt-Service-Url>}" \
    --memory-size 128 \
    --timeout 20
```

### Usage

The Sample AWS Lambda Function in .NET illustrates the usage and various operations, via separate handlers,
that can be performed using [.NET SDK for Bolt](https://gitlab.com/projectn-oss/bolt-sdk-net).
The deployed AWS lambda function can be tested from the AWS Management Console by creating a test event and
specifying its inputs in JSON format.

Please ensure that `Bolt` is deployed before testing the sample AWS lambda function. If you haven't deployed `Bolt`,
follow the instructions given [here](https://xyz.projectn.co/installation-guide#estimate-savings) to deploy `Bolt`.

#### Testing Bolt or S3 Operations

`BoltS3OpsHandler` is the handler that enables the user to perform Bolt or S3 operations.
It sends a Bucket or Object request to Bolt or S3 and returns an appropriate response based on the parameters
passed in as input.

* BoltS3OpsHandler is the handler that is invoked by AWS Lambda to process an incoming event.


* BoltS3OpsHandler accepts the following input parameters as part of the event:
  * sdkType - Endpoint to which request is sent. The following values are supported:
    * S3 - The Request is sent to S3.
    * Bolt - The Request is sent to Bolt, whose endpoint is configured via 'BOLT_URL' environment variable
      
  * requestType - type of request / operation to be performed. The following requests are supported:
    * list_objects_v2 - list objects
    * list_buckets - list buckets
    * head_object - head object
    * head_bucket - head bucket
    * get_object - get object (md5 hash)
    * put_object - upload object
    * delete_object - delete object
      
  * bucket - bucket name
    
  * key - key name


* Following are examples of events, for various requests, that can be used to invoke the handler.
    * Listing first 1000 objects from Bolt bucket:
      ```json
        {"requestType": "list_objects_v2", "sdkType": "BOLT", "bucket": "<bucket>"}
      ```
    * Listing buckets from S3:
      ```json
      {"requestType": "list_buckets", "sdkType": "S3"}
      ```
    * Get Bolt object metadata (HeadObject):
      ```json
      {"requestType": "head_object", "sdkType": "BOLT", "bucket": "<bucket>", "key": "<key>"}
      ```
    * Check if S3 bucket exists (HeadBucket):
      ```json
      {"requestType": "head_bucket","sdkType": "S3", "bucket": "<bucket>"}
      ```  
    * Retrieve object (its MD5 Hash) from Bolt:
      ```json
      {"requestType": "get_object", "sdkType": "BOLT", "bucket": "<bucket>", "key": "<key>"}
      ```  
    * Upload object to Bolt:
      ```json
      {"requestType": "put_object", "sdkType": "BOLT", "bucket": "<bucket>", "key": "<key>", "value": "<value>"}
      ```  
    * Delete object from Bolt:
      ```json
      {"requestType": "delete_object", "sdkType": "BOLT", "bucket": "<bucket>", "key": "<key>"}
      ```
      

#### Data Validation Tests

`BoltS3ValidateObjHandler` is the handler that enables the user to perform data validation tests. It retrieves
the object from Bolt and S3 (Bucket Cleaning is disabled), computes and returns their corresponding MD5 hash.
If the object is gzip encoded, object is decompressed before computing its MD5.


* BoltS3ValidateObjHandler is a handler that is invoked by AWS Lambda to process an incoming event for performing 
  data validation tests. To use this handler, change the handler of the Lambda function to 
  `BoltS3ValidateObjHandler.lambda_handler`


* BoltS3ValidateObjHandler accepts the following input parameters as part of the event:
  * bucket - bucket name
  
  * key - key name


* Following is an example of an event that can be used to invoke the handler.
  * Retrieve object(its MD5 hash) from Bolt and S3:
    
    If the object is gzip encoded, object is decompressed before computing its MD5.
    ```json
    {"bucket": "<bucket>", "key": "<key>"}
    ```
    
#### Performance Tests

`BoltS3PerfHandler` is the handler that enables the user to run Bolt or S3 Performance tests. It measures the 
performance of Bolt or S3 Operations and returns statistics based on the operation. Before using this
handler, ensure that a source bucket has been crunched by `Bolt` with cleaner turned `OFF`. `Get, List Objects` tests
are run using the first 1000 objects in the bucket and `Put Object` tests are run using objects of size `100 bytes`.
`Delete Object` tests are run on objects that were created by the `Put Object` test.

* BoltS3PerfHandler is a handler function that is invoked by AWS Lambda to process an incoming event
  for Bolt/S3 Performance testing. To use this handler, change the handler of the Lambda function to 
  `BoltS3PerfHandler.lambda_handler`
  

* BoltS3PerfHandler accepts the following input parameters as part of the event:
  * requestType - type of request / operation to be performed. The following requests are supported:
    * list_objects_v2 - list objects
    * get_object - get object
    * get_object_ttfb - get object (first byte) 
    * get_object_passthrough - get object (via passthrough) of unmonitored bucket
    * get_object_passthrough_ttfb - get object (first byte via passthrough) of unmonitored bucket 
    * put_object - upload object
    * delete_object - delete object
    * all - put, get, delete, list objects (default request if none specified)
      
  * bucket - bucket name
    

* Following are examples of events, for various requests, that can be used to invoke the handler.
    * Measure List objects performance of Bolt / S3.
      ```json
      {"requestType": "list_objects_v2", "bucket": "<bucket>"}
      ```
    * Measure Get object performance of Bolt / S3.
      ```json
      {"requestType": "get_object", "bucket": "<bucket>"}
      ```
    * Measure Get object (first byte) performance of Bolt / S3.
      ```json
      {"requestType": "get_object_ttfb", "bucket": "<bucket>"}
      ```
    * Measure Get object passthrough performance of Bolt.
      ```json
      {"requestType": "get_object_passthrough", "bucket": "<unmonitored-bucket>"}
      ```
    * Measure Get object passthrough (first byte) performance of Bolt.
      ```json
      {"requestType": "get_object_passthrough_ttfb", "bucket": "<unmonitored-bucket>"}
      ```
    * Measure Put object performance of Bolt / S3.
      ```json
      {"requestType": "put_object", "bucket": "<bucket>"}
      ```
    * Measure Delete object performance of Bolt / S3.
      ```json
      {"requestType": "delete_object", "bucket": "<bucket>"}
      ```
    * Measure Put, Delete, Get, List objects performance of Bolt / S3.
      ```json
      {"requestType": "all", "bucket": "<bucket>"}
      ```
      
#### Auto Heal Tests

`BoltAutoHealHandler` is the handler that enables the user to run auto heal tests. Before running this handler,
modify `data-cruncher` to use `standard` tier-class and set `backupduration` and `recoveryscannerperiod` to `1 minute`
to ensure that the auto-healing duration is within the lambda execution timeout interval. Crunch a sample bucket having
a single object. Then delete the single fragment object from the `n-data`bucket. Now run this handler, passing the name
of the crunched bucket along with the single object as input parameters to the handler. The handler attempts to
retrieve object repeatedly until it succeeds, which would indicate successful auto-healing of the object and returns
the time taken to do so.

* BoltAutoHealHandler is a handler function that is invoked by AWS Lambda to process an incoming event
  for performing Auto-Heal testing.  To use this handler, change the handler of the Lambda function to
  `BoltAutoHealHandler.lambda_handler`.
  
* BoltAutoHealHandler accepts the following input parameters as part of the event:
  * bucket - bucket name
  
  * key - key name
    

* Following is an example of an event that can be used to invoke the handler.
    * Measure Auto-Heal time of an object in Bolt.
      ```json
      {"bucket": "<bucket>", "key": "<key>"}
      ```
